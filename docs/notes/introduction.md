# Introduction with Examples
We shortly introduce the fundamental components of Beta-RecSys through self-contained examples. 
At its core, Beta-RecSys provides the following main features:

## Load Build-in Datasets

## Run Matrix Factorization model

## Evaluate the model

## Tune hyper-parameters for the Matrix Factorization model

## Build a Matrix Factorization model with less codes
